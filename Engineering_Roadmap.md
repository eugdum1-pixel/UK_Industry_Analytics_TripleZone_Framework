# 🗺️ Project Engineering Roadmap
This benchmark outlines the technical pipeline used to transform raw industrial data into validated intelligence units.

Stage 1: Ingestion: Processing of the local document corpus (~14,000 units).

Stage 2: Vectorisation: Generation of semantic embeddings (stored locally to maintain high performance).

Stage 3: Distillation: Extraction of 141 High-Fidelity Intelligence Units.

Stage 4: Validation: Final integrity check resulting in a 99.9% verification rate.
