<p align="center"> <h1>🚀 LOCAL AI ARCHITECTURE: MCP vs. RAG</h1> <h3>Architecting Intelligence from Raw Data Units</h3> </p>

📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the end-to-end engineering required to transform raw data into a professional AI knowledge system. Whether working with a custom dataset (in this project: 13,938 data units extracted from UK industry reports) or your own proprietary data, this repository provides the blueprint for two distinct integration paths:

MCP (Model Context Protocol): Direct tool-based connection.

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation): Semantic vector-based memory.

The objective is to guide a Junior Data Analyst through the transition from raw, fragmented files to a production-ready AI context.

Stage 1: Data Validation & Schema Enforcement
Raw data is often noisy. This stage focuses on Data Wrangling. We implement scripts to ensure every data unit adheres to a strict schema, removing duplicates and correcting encoding errors.

Stage 2: Semantic Metadata Enrichment
To improve retrieval accuracy, data must be contextualized. We programmatically tag chunks with relevant metadata (e.g., Sector, Source, or Region).

Stage 3: Vectorization & Neural Embeddings
Text is converted into high-dimensional vectors. This enables Semantic Search—finding information based on meaning rather than just keywords.

Stage 4: Vector Database Implementation
We utilize specialized databases like ChromaDB to store these embeddings locally, optimizing for sub-second retrieval speeds.

Stage 5: Inference & Pipeline Integration
The final stage connects the local inference engine (e.g., Ollama) to the data, allowing models like Qwen or DeepSeek to generate grounded answers.

🧩 Path A: The MCP Approach (Standardized Connection)
The Model Context Protocol (MCP) allows AI models to securely access local data and tools via a standardized server interface.

The Workflow:

Step 1: Initialize an MCP Server using Python or TypeScript.

Step 2: Expose your data directory as a Resource within the server.

Step 3: Define Tools — custom scripts that allow the AI to search or filter through your files (in this project: searching the 139 JSON files).

Step 4: The AI "calls" these tools dynamically to fetch only the necessary data.

🧠 Path B: The RAG Approach (Deep Memory)
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) involves pre-processing data into a "Vector Store" to allow the AI to "remember" vast amounts of information.

The Workflow:

Step 1: Data Ingestion (Chunking → Embedding → Storage).

Step 2: Vector Indexing (Creating a mathematical map of the data).

Step 3: Semantic Retrieval (Finding data based on the "intent" of a query).

Step 4: Context Injection (Feeding the retrieved data into the LLM prompt).

Feature	MCP (Model Context Protocol)	RAG (Retrieval-Augmented)
Data Access	Direct / Real-time	Pre-processed / Vectorized
Setup Complexity	Medium (Server-based)	High (Pipeline-based)
Primary Use Case	Interacting with local files/tools	Querying large knowledge bases
Flexibility	High (Executes local code)	Low (Queries static index)

<p align="center"> <h2>🚀 GETTING STARTED: STAGE 1 EXECUTION</h2> </p>

Regardless of the path chosen, Data Validation is the mandatory first step. We must ensure that the dataset (in this project: the 139 "Diamonds" JSON files) is technically sound.

Technical Task: validate_chunks.py
This script acts as the "Gatekeeper" for the pipeline, performing three critical checks:

JSON Syntax Verification: Prevents parsing errors during AI ingestion.

Schema Integrity: Confirms mandatory fields (e.g., text, id) are present.

UTF-8 Compliance: Ensures the text is readable by modern LLMs without encoding crashes.

Python

### validate_chunks.py - Pipeline Initialization
import json
import os

def validate_data_integrity(target_path):
    """Scan and validate JSON files for schema compliance."""
    # Implementation details follow in the Stage 1 module
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Path to the data directory (Adjust to your local path)
    DATA_DIR = "./data/chunks" 
    validate_data_integrity(DATA_DIR)
Next Steps in the Learning Path:
Now that the README.md framework is ready for your portfolio, should we move to the Full Implementation of the Stage 1 Validation Script? This will produce the first real report for your project.
